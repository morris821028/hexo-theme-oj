## Welcome to the UVa Online Judge ##
Here you will find hundreds of problems. They are like the ones used during programming contests, and are available in HTML and PDF formats. You can submit your sources in a variety of languages, trying to solve any of the problems available in our database.

See the new Contest Rankings section at the Live Rankings link.

Now you can use the new Quick access, info and search option on the left menu for and easier navigation. (The tool will be updated next days for a more complete information)

 Follow us on Twitter @UVaOnlineJudge !!

Are you proud of your solutions? Do you have anything to show the rest of the problemsolvers? We're looking for people to help us in the publishing of a collection of books with solutions for the problems in the UVa Online Judge. More information here.
